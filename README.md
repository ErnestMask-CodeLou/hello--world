Hello, my name is Ernest Mask, I am a 27 year old african american man born and raise form louisivlle , kentucky. I am so excited to be apart of you guys program. I am currently working in the chemical manufacturing industry. It pays well but is very physically-demanding and very hazardous. I pray that this can be a new start into the actually field that I want to be apart of. Thank You!
